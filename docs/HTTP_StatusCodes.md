## ðŸ“– What are HTTP Status Codes?

HTTP **status codes** are 3-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a client's request to indicate the result of the request. They tell the client whether:

* the request was successful,
* there was an error, or
* some further action is needed.

## ðŸ“Š HTTP Status Code Classes

Theyâ€™re grouped by their first digit:

| Class   | Range   | Meaning                                                                   |
| :------ | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1xx** | 100â€“199 | Informational â€” request received, continuing process                      |
| **2xx** | 200â€“299 | Success â€” the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted |
| **3xx** | 300â€“399 | Redirection â€” further action needs to be taken to complete the request    |
| **4xx** | 400â€“499 | Client Error â€” the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled     |
| **5xx** | 500â€“599 | Server Error â€” the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request   |

## ðŸ“Œ Quick FastAPI Example of Using Status Codes

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, status

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/resource/{item_id}")
def read_resource(item_id: int):
    if item_id == 0:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail="Item not found")
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```
